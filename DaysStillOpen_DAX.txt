Use Case - ServiceNow data, where each ticket has an open date and a resolved/closed date. need to find out how many tickets were in "open" state by dates.

Create a Calculated Table, deriving from the ServiceNow table:

ServiceNow_for_Open_Counts =
SELECTCOLUMNS(
  FILTER(
    CROSSJOIN(
      ADDCOLUMNS(
        CALENDAR("2025-01-01", TODAY()),
        "Still Open On", var d = [Date] - 1 RETURN DATE(YEAR(d), MONTH(d), DAY(d))
          ),
    'ServiceNow_Table'),
    [Date] > [Opened On] && [Date] <= IF([Resolved_Closed_Date] = BLANK(), "2099-01-01",[Resolved_Closed_Date])
    ),
"Still Open On", [Still Open On],
"Incident ID", [Incident ID], "Assignment Group", [Assignment Group], "Priority", [Priority], "State", [State]
)

Create a measure -
Open_Count = DISTINCTCOUNT('ServiceNow_for_Open_Counts'[Incident_ID])
